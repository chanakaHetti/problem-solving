4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## problem solving steps

1. Undestand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down

### Explore concrete examples

1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs
